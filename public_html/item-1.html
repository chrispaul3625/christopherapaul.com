	<em> Sprots Project</em>
	<p> <img src="public_html/documentation/images/Sprots.png" class="img-responsive"> </p>
	<em> What is Sports?</em>
	<p> Sprots is a dynamic website that allows users to access statistics to various different teams in the NFL, NHL, NBA, and MLB. Users can create an account with us which allows them to favorite their favorite teams and receive updated scores and statistics on those teams, so that they don't have to navigate through all the teams in a league. There are dynamic search options that are built into the page as well allowing users to type in a team or players name that auto sorts through a table of teams or players so that the user can quickly find a player or team.  </p>

	<em> Technical aspects of the project Sprots</em>
	<p> Sprots was created by a team of 5, including myself. We built the entire project from scratch, creating ERD models to help us visualize the project, creating the database to store all of our statistics and information for the website including profiles, writing out classes in PHP, writing code to sanitize all input areas to protect the site from hackers, We wrote code that would reach out to an external API which is where all the statistical data of the site would come from and cache it into our database. We also created wireframes and diagrams for the layout of the pages and finally used Angular JS to make the page a single page application allowing for quick page transitions being that our site has so much data. Lastly we designed the site with CSS and bootstrap.  </p>

	<em> What's next for Sprots?</em>
	<p> Sprots was built as a project in a 10 week long programming class. In this short period of time we were able to accomplish everything talked about above, however the external API that we were getting all our statistical information from moved to a paid subscription that we were not able to continue to keep as the costs were not within our groups budget. We did take the site offline after this. In the future we plan to continue to explore different API sources and also plan to add other sports to the website as well and bring the site live once again. Feel free to check out our work on this project at https://github.com/chrispaul3625/sprots.  </p>
	<em> Interests and fun facts about me</em>
	<p>
		I love being able to escape to the outdoors. When I am not designing web pages or on the pitch of a soccer field I like to get outside and do something active and fun. I enjoy being out in the water, whether it be on a boat, paddle board, surf board, or whatever. I find being out in the water one of the most relaxing and enjoyable places to be. I almost enjoy being in the water as much as my 3 dogs. Being active and fit are important to me, I do my best work when I can keep myself healthy. A healthy body = a healthy mind!
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a diverse background when it comes to my work history. I have done many things and acquired many useful skills along the way. I went from studying to be a physical therapist to finally landing in the IT field and began studying programming and web development.
