	<em> Interests and fun facts about me</em>
	<p>
		I love being able to escape to the outdoors. When I am not designing webpages or on the pitch of a soccer field I like to get outside and do something active and fun. I enjoy being out in the water, whether it be on a boat, paddle board, surf board, or whatever. I find being out in the water one of the most relaxing and enjoyable places to be. I almost enjoy being in the water as much as my 3 dogs. Being active and fit are important to me, I do my best work when I can keep myself healthy. A healthy body = a healthy mind!
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a diverse background when it comes to my work histoy. I have done many things and accuried many useful skills along the way. I went from studying to be a physical therapist to finally landing in the IT field and began studying programming and web development.
